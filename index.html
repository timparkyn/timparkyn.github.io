	<h1>Some things about my riding</h1>

	<h2>I'm a late morning and afternoon rider</h2>
		<p>Some people like to wake up early and ride. I like to have some coffee, breakfast, think about the day a bit, and then go ride.<br><br></p>

	<h3>Fair weather rider</h3>
	<p>I like to ride when it's nice and warm. When it's cold, I'll do something else, go for a run or something.<br><br></p>

	<h2>I don't race</h2>
	<p>I don't care if I'm faster or slower than anyone else. It's not a competition. But please don't hold me up on the downhills.<br><br></p>
	

	<h3>Bikes in the stable:</h3>
		<ul id="list">
			<li>Turner Five Spot</li>
			<li>BMC Gran Fondo</li>
			<li>Public C7</li>
			<li>Cannondale Synapse</li>
			<li>Santa Cruz Superlight</li>
		</ul>

	<p>So I'm not much for racing, but sometimes I enjoy watching a race (click image for video):</p>

	<a href="http://www.petefagerlin.com/">Here's a older site about mountain biking adventures</a>
	<p>It's mostly basic HTML here, but I don't quite understand how the columns are done. There's also a bit of javascript here that I don't know. It was a good site at the time, now it seems antiquated.
